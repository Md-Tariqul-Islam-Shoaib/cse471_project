Run in the terminal:

```
pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
pip install bcrypt
pip install flask-share
pip install flask_login
python app.py
   or, py.exe -3 app.py
```

> Here, we used **Beautiful Soup**, a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.

> **bcrypt** is a password-hashing function that turns a simple password into fixed-length characters called a hash. Before hashing a password, bcrypt applies a salt â€” a unique random string that makes the hash unpredictable.
